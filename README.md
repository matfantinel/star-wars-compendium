# Star Wars Compendium

A single place for all the Star Wars characters.

## About the Project

This is a standard NextJS app with TypeScript. I've chosen it because it provides a quick way to setup an application with great defaults. I've used SASS for styling, more as a way of displaying my familiarity with it, but for a project of this size I don't think it'd be necessary.

For fetching data, I've used [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) because, being Hooks-based, it plays nice with React, as well as providing caching and revalidation out of the box.
